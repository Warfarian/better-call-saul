## Description

"Better Call Saul" is a retro-inspired website celebrating Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. It recreates the vibrant, quirky aesthetic of 1990s internet, combining humor, nostalgia, and legal themes for an engaging experience.



## Technologies Used

### HTML: 
Structure and content( I used deprecated tags like tables for the whole layout and marquee tags).
### CSS: 
Styling with bold colors and playful fonts (as much inline styling as possible to be accurate to the era).
### JavaScript: 
Interactivity and dynamic elements (as minimal js as possible but had to use it for the eventlisteners).




## Key Features

## Inspiration

I was primarily inspired by the aesthetics of the various websites that were popular during the 90s. Very grateful for the wayback machine as I could time travel back to that era and check out all the creativity that was prevalent back then.





## What I learnt

I learnt that HTML is responsive by default, marquee tags were a thing, table layouts are kinda hard to work with and also websites used to be very cool.


This was a very fun hackathon and actually my second! Thank you so much for Cod√©dex for the opportunity!


I have been learning react the past month and was hoping to use that but then it would've seemed too modern and would have been difficult to use the deprecated old school tags so I just stuck with html css and js.
